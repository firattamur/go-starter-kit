## 01 - Hello World in Go!

As is tradition, we'll start with a "Hello World" program.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

To run this program, we'll need to use the `go run` command.

```bash
$ go run hello-world.go

Hello World!
```

Let's break down the code above.

```go
package main
```

Every Go program starts with a package declaration. Packages are Go's way of organizing and reusing code. The package `main` is special. It defines a standalone executable program, not a library.

```go
func main() {
    // ...
}
```

Next we have the `main` function. It is the entry point for the executable program. It has no parameters and no return value. In Go, curly braces `{}` are always required, even if the body of the function is empty.

```go
fmt.Println("Hello World!")
```

Finally, we call a function called `Println` from the `fmt` package. Notice that we access the function using dot notation. This is called a qualified identifier in Go.

## ðŸš€ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to create a Go program that prints "Hello, Go!" instead of "Hello, World!". You should save this program as `hello_go.go` and run it using the `go run` command. Here is a skeleton of the code to get you started:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
// Your code here
}
```

After you have finished writing your code, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
$ go run hello_go.go
```

Your program should output:

```bash
Hello, Go!
```

The goal here is to practice using the `fmt` package to print messages to the console. Good luck!
