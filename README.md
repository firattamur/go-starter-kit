    <summary>01 - Hello World in Go:</summary>

As is tradition, we'll start with a "Hello World" program.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

To run this program, we'll need to use the `go run` command.

```bash
$ go run hello-world.go

Hello World!
```

Let's break down the code above.

```go
package main
```

Every Go program starts with a package declaration. Packages are Go's way of organizing and reusing code. The package `main` is special. It defines a standalone executable program, not a library.

```go
func main() {
    // ...
}
```

Next we have the `main` function. It is the entry point for the executable program. It has no parameters and no return value. In Go, curly braces `{}` are always required, even if the body of the function is empty.

```go
fmt.Println("Hello World!")
```

Finally, we call a function called `Println` from the `fmt` package. Notice that we access the function using dot notation. This is called a qualified identifier in Go.

### üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to create a Go program that prints "Hello, Go!" instead of "Hello, World!". You should save this program as `hello_go.go` and run it using the `go run` command. Here is a skeleton of the code to get you started:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
// Your code here
}
```

After you have finished writing your code, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
$ go run hello_go.go
```

Your program should output:

```bash
Hello, Go!
```

The goal here is to practice using the `fmt` package to print messages to the console. Good luck!

    <summary>02 - Data Types in Go:</summary>

- Go is a statically typed language. This means that variables always have a specific type and that type cannot change.

- Go is also a strongly typed language, which means that variables can only be coerced to another type with an explicit conversion.

- Go has the following built-in types:

  - `bool`
  - `string`
  - `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
  - `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uintptr`
  - `byte` (alias for `uint8`)
  - `rune` (alias for `int32`, represents a Unicode code point)
  - `float32`, `float64`
  - `complex64`, `complex128`

- Go does not have a `char` type. Instead, `rune` is used to represent a Unicode code point.

- To declare a variable in Go, we use the `var` keyword:

  ```go
  var a int
  ```

- The type comes after the variable name.

- We can also initialize the variable with a value:

  ```go
  var a int = 42
  ```

- Go can infer the type of initialized variables:

  ```go
  var a = 42
  ```

- Let's look at some examples of declaring variables with different types:

  ```go
  var a bool = true
  var b string = "Hello World"
  var c int = 42
  var d float64 = 3.14
  var e complex128 = 3 + 5i
  var f byte = 'a'
  var g rune = '‚ò∫'
  ```

- We can also declare multiple variables in one statement:

  ```go
    var a, b, c int = 1, 2, 3
  ```

- Go also has short variable declarations using the `:=` operator:

  ```go
    a := 42
  ```

- Short variable declarations can only be used inside functions.

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `types.go` which does the following:

1. Declare a `string` variable named `hello` and assign the value "Hello, Go!" to it.
2. Declare an `int` variable named `year` and assign the current year to it.
3. Print both variables using the `fmt.Println()` function.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
// Your code here
}
```

To run your program, use this command:

```bash
$ go run types.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
Hello, Go! 2023
```

This challenge will help you practice declaring variables, assigning values, and printing values in Go. Good luck! üçÄ

    <summary>03 - Variables in Go:</summary>

- Variables are used to store values in memory.

- Go is a statically typed language, which means that variables always have a specific type and that type cannot change.

- Go is also a strongly typed language, which means that variables can only be coerced to another type with an explicit conversion.

- To declare a variable in Go, we use the `var` keyword:

  ```go

  ```

- The type comes after the variable name.

- We can also initialize the variable with a value:

  ```go
  var a int = 42
  ```

- Go can infer the type of initialized variables:

  ```go
    var a = 42
  ```

- Short variable declarations are also possible:

  ```go
    a := 42
  ```

- We can also declare multiple variables at once:

  ```go
    var a, b int = 1, 2
  ```

- Go also supports parallel assignment:

  ```go
    a, b := 1, 2
  ```

- Go also supports assigning multiple variables at once:

  ```go
    a, b := 1, 2
  ```

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `variables.go` which does the following:

1. Declare an `int` variable named `a` and assign the value 10 to it.
2. Declare an `int` variable named `b` and assign the value 20 to it.
3. Use parallel assignment to swap the values of `a` and `b`.
4. Print the values of `a` and `b` after the swap.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
// Your code here
}
```

To run your program, use this command:

```bash
$ go run variables.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
20 10
```

This challenge will help you practice declaring variables, assigning values, and using parallel assignment in Go. Good luck! üçÄ

    <summary>04 - Constants in Go:</summary>

- Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.

- Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.

- Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

  ```go
  const a := 42 // will raise the error: syntax error: unexpected :=, expecting =
  ```

- An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.

- Let's look at some examples of declaring constants:

  ```go
  const a = 42
  const b = 3.14
  const c = "Hello World"
  const d = true
  ```

- Constants can also be declared using parentheses:

  ```go
    const (
        a = 42
        b = 3.14
        c = "Hello World"
        d = true
    )
  ```

- Constants can also be declared using the iota identifier:

  ```go
    const (
        a = iota
        b = iota
        c = iota
    )
  ```

  - iota starts at 0 and increments by one for each item in the list.

- Let's look at another example:

  ```go
  const (
      a = iota
      b
      c
  )
  ```

  - In this example, b and c will also be set to 1 and 2, respectively.

- Let's look a complete program that uses constants:

  ```go
  package main

  import "fmt"

  const (
      a = iota
      b
      c
  )

  const (
      d = iota
      e
      f
  )

  func main() {
      fmt.Println(a, b, c)
      fmt.Println(d, e, f)
  }
  ```

  - This program will print:

    ```bash
    0 1 2
    0 1 2
    ```

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `constants.go` which does the following:

1. Declare a set of constants for the first 5 prime numbers, using the `iota` identifier.

2. Print each of these constants.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Your constants here

func main() {
// Your code here
}
```

To run your program, use this command:

```bash
$ go run constants.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
2 3 5 7 11
```

This challenge will help you practice declaring constants and using the `iota` identifier in Go. Good luck! üçÄ

<details>
    <summary>05 - For Loops in Go:</summary>

- Go has only one looping construct, the `for` loop.

- The basic `for` loop has three components separated by semicolons:

  ```go
  for initialization; condition; post {
    // zero or more statements
  }
  ```

  - The initialization statement is executed before the first iteration.

  - The condition expression is evaluated before every iteration.

  - The post statement is executed at the end of every iteration.

- Let's look at a simple example:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
            fmt.Println(i)
        }
    }

  ```

  - This program will print:

    ```bash
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    ```

- The initialization and post statements are optional:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        i := 0
        for i < 5 {
            fmt.Println(i)
            i++
        }
    }
  ```

  - This program will print the same output as the previous example.

- If you omit the loop condition, it loops forever:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        i := 0
        for {
            fmt.Println(i)
            i++
        }
    }
  ```

  - This program will print forever.

- You can also use the `break` and `continue` statements inside a `for` loop:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
            if i == 3 {
            continue
            }
            fmt.Println(i)
        }
    }
  ```

  - This program will print:

    ```bash
    0
    1
    2
    4
    ```

- To break out of a loop, you can use the `break` statement:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
            if i == 3 {
            break
            }
            fmt.Println(i)
        }
    }
  ```

  - This program will print:

    ```bash
    0
    1
    2
    ```

- There is no `while` loop in Go, but you can mimic it using the `for` loop:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        i := 0
        for i < 5 {
            fmt.Println(i)
            i++
        }
    }
  ```

  - This program will print:

    ```bash
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    ```

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `for_loops.go` which does the following:

1. Use a `for` loop to iterate 0 to 5.
2. In each iteration, check if the number is even. If the number is even, print the number. Otherwise, skip to the next iteration.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
// Your code here
}
```

To run your program, use this command:

```bash
$ go run for_loops.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
0
2
4
```

This challenge will help you practice using for loops, arrays, and conditional statements in Go. Good luck! üçÄ

<details>
    <summary>06 - If/Else Statements in Go:</summary>

- Similar to other languages, Go has an `if` statement for conditional execution.

- Simple `if` statement:

  ```go
    if true {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    }
  ```

- Simple `if/else` statement:

  ```go
    if true {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Goodbye, Go!")
    }
  ```

- `if/else if/else` statement:

  ```go
    if true {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    } else if false {
        fmt.Println("Goodbye, Go!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("See you later, Go!")
    }
  ```

- `if` statements can also be used to initialize variables:

  ```go
    if a := 42; a == 42 {
        fmt.Println("a: ", a)
    }
  ```

- `if` statements can also be used to initialize multiple variables:

  ```go
    if a, b := 42, 3.14; a == 42 {
        fmt.Println("a: ", a)
        fmt.Println("b: ", b)
    }
  ```

- Go does not have a ternary `?:` operator. You must use an `if` statement instead:

  ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        a := 42
        b := 3.14

        if a == 42 {
            fmt.Println("a: ", a)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("b: ", b)
        }
    }
  ```

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `if_else.go` which does the following:

1. Declare an `int` variable named `a` and assign the value 10 to it.

2. Declare an `int` variable named `b` and assign the value 20 to it.

3. Write an `if/else` statement that prints the larger of the two variables.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Your code here
}
```

After you have finished writing your code, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
$ go run if_else.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
20
```

This challenge will help you practice using if/else statements in Go. Good luck! üçÄ

<details>
    <summary>07 - Switch Statements in Go:</summary>

- Go has a `switch` statement for conditional execution.

- Simple `switch` statement:

  ```go
    i := 2

    switch i {
        case 1:
            fmt.Println("one")
        case 2:
            fmt.Println("two")
        default:
            fmt.Println("not one or two")
    }
  ```

- `switch` statements can also be used to initialize variables:

  ```go
    switch i := 2; i {
        case 1:
            fmt.Println("one")
        case 2:
            fmt.Println("two")
        default:
            fmt.Println("not one or two")
    }
  ```

- There can be multiple expressions in a `case` statement:

  ```go
    switch i := 2; i {
        case 1, 2, 3:
            fmt.Println("one, two, or three")
        case 4, 5, 6:
            fmt.Println("four, five, or six")
        default:
            fmt.Println("another number")
    }
  ```

- We can also use the `fallthrough` keyword to execute the next `case` statement:

  ```go
    switch i := 2; i {
        case 1, 2, 3:
            fmt.Println("one, two, or three")
            fallthrough
        case 4, 5, 6:
            fmt.Println("four, five, or six")
        default:
            fmt.Println("another number")
    }
  ```

  - `fallthrough` is not the default behavior in Go. It must be explicitly stated.

  - A useful example of a `fallthrough` is when we want to check for a range of values:

  ```go
    switch i := 2; i {
        case 1, 2, 3:
            fmt.Println("one, two, or three")
            fallthrough
        case 4, 5, 6:
            fmt.Println("four, five, or six")
            fallthrough
        case 7, 8, 9:
            fmt.Println("seven, eight, or nine")
        default:
            fmt.Println("another number")
    }
  ```

  - Output:

    ```
    one, two, or three
    four, five, or six
    seven, eight, or nine
    ```

- `switch` statements can also be used to check the type of interface:

  ```go
      var i interface{} = 1

      switch i.(type) {
          case int:
              fmt.Println("i is an int")
          case float64:
              fmt.Println("i is a float64")
          case string:
              fmt.Println("i is a string")
          default:
              fmt.Println("i is another type")
      }
  ```

  - Output:

    ```
    i is an int
    ```

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `switch.go` which does the following:

1. Declare a `string` variable named `customerType` and assign a value to it (e.g., "regular", "premium", "vip", or any other string).

2. Write a `switch` statement that prints the following messages depending on the value of `customerType`:

   - "You have earned 10 points!" if `customerType` is "regular".

   - "You have earned 30 points!" if `customerType` is "premium".

   - "You have earned 50 points!" if `customerType` is "vip".

   - "You have earned 0 points!" if `customerType` is anything else.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    customerType := "regular"
    // Your code here

}
```

After you have finished writing your code, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
$ go run switch.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
You have earned 10 points!
```

This challenge will help you practice using switch statements in Go. Good luck! üçÄ

    <summary>08 - Arrays in Go:</summary>

- Arrays are fixed-length sequences of elements of a single type.

- Arrays are declared using brackets:

  ```go
    var a [5]int
  ```

- Arrays are zero-indexed:

  ```go
    a[0] = 1
    a[1] = 2
    a[2] = 3
    a[3] = 4
    a[4] = 5
  ```

- Arrays can also be initialized with values:

  ```go
    var a = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

- Arrays can also be initialized without specifying the length:

  ```go
    var a = [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

- Arrays can also be initialized using indexes:

  ```go
    var a = [...]int{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 5}
  ```

- Arrays initialized with default value of 0, if not specified:

  ```go
    var a = [5]int{1, 2, 3}
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    [1 2 3 0 0]
    ```

- Arrays can also be initialized using the `new` keyword:

  ```go
      var a = new([5]int)
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    &[0 0 0 0 0]
    ```

    - `new` returns a pointer to the array.

    - We can access the elements of the array using the pointer:

      ```go
        var a = new([5]int)
        a[0] = 1
        a[1] = 2
        a[2] = 3
        a[3] = 4
        a[4] = 5

        fmt.Println(a)
      ```

      - Output:

        ```bash
        &[1 2 3 4 5]
        ```

- Arrays can also be declared using the `:=` operator:

  ```go
    a := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

- To get the length of an array, we can use the `len` function:

  ```go
    var a = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println(len(a))
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    5
    ```

- We can also declare multi-dimensional arrays:

  ```go
    var a = [2][2]int{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    [[1 2] [3 4]]
    ```

- To access the elements of a multi-dimensional array, we can use the following syntax:

  ```go
    var a = [2][2]int{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
    fmt.Println(a[0][0])
    fmt.Println(a[0][1])
    fmt.Println(a[1][0])
    fmt.Println(a[1][1])
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    1
    2
    3
    4
    ```

- We can also use the `for` loop to iterate over an array:

  ```go
      var a = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

      for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
          fmt.Println(a[i])
      }
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    ```

- We can also use the `range` keyword to iterate over an array:

  ```go
      var a = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

      for i, v := range a {
          fmt.Println(i, v)
      }
  ```

  - Output:

    ```bash
    0 1
    1 2
    2 3
    3 4
    4 5
    ```

## üöÄ Coding Challenge:

Your task is to write a Go program named `arrays.go` which does the following:

1. Declare an array of 5 `int` elements named `a` and assign the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to it.

2. Print the array.

3. Print the length of the array.

4. Declare a multi-dimensional array of 2x2 `int` elements named `b` and assign the values 1, 2, 3, 4 to it.

5. Print the multi-dimensional array.

6. Print the length of the multi-dimensional array.

7. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array and print each element.

8. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the multi-dimensional array and print each element.

You can start with the following code skeleton:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Your code here
}
```

To run your program, use this command:

```bash
$ go run arrays.go
```

The expected output of your program should be:

```bash
[1 2 3 4 5]
5
[[1 2] [3 4]]
2
1
2
3
4
5
1
2
3
4
```

This challenge will help you practice using arrays in Go. Good luck! üçÄ
